- 👋 Hi, I'm Mark Riale. I enjoy programming in my day job and keeping up with tech. I am also a husband to a wonderful woman and a father of two amazing children.
- 👀 I'm interested in:
  - computer graphics
  -  Linux
  - old arcade games (like Pacman and Frogger)
  - old Commodore computers (like the Amiga and C64).
- 🌱 I'm currently learning how to 3D print.
- 💞️ I'm looking for help with [PyDPainter](https://github.com/mriale/PyDPainter) if anyone wants to collaborate with me on it.
- 📫 You can reach me at:
